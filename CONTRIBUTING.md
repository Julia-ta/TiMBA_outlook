# Contributing to TiMBA

-----------------
Thank you for considering a contribution to TiMBA. This document outlines the guidelines and processes for contributing.

To suggest and discuss possible model improvements, new features, or to raise questions related to the use of TiMBA or the understanding of the software code, we invite you to contact us via [wf-timba@thuenen.de](mailto:wf-timba@thuenen.de) or initiate a topic under the [Github discussion section](#https://github.com/TI-Forest-Sector-Modelling/TiMBA/discussions). 

Below you can find some guidance that helps us to streamline the integration of your code contributions or facilitate addressing
any issues you report.

## Contributing code

-----------------
If you consider to contribute new code to TiMBA, please consider the following guidelines:
- Follow PEP8 coding style. 
- Add docstrings for new functions and classes. 
- Include tests for any new features or fixes. 
- Keep commits small, clear, and focused.
- Submit pull requests with a clear description of the changes and reference the related issue (`Closes #issue number`).

If you are interested in adding a new feature to TiMBA, consider submitting your feature proposal via [wf-timba@thuenen.de](mailto:wf-timba@thuenen.de),
which is the preferred forum for discussing new features.

## Reporting issues

-----------------
When reporting issues, please include as much relevant information as possible, such as your operating 
system, the TiMBA version, and python version you are using. Whenever possible, please also include a brief, self-contained code
example that reproduces the problem. We provide an issue template to help to streamline the process and ensure that 
reports are clear and actionable.

We provide contributors an issue template that enables straightforward contribution in order to help us to cut through noise and to push your project forward (Link zu Template?).

Given our team size and limited capacities, we cannot garantee short-notice solution for issues. Contributions in 
the form of self-initiated fixes or suggestions are therefore highly appreciated. 

*Note on branches and merge strategy*: Branching and merging follows an internal workflow of the TiMBA team. The main branch is always kept in a valid and stable state, and it is the branch where issues can be raised. These issues are then processed in dedicated feature or issue branches, which are subsequently merged back into main in a predefined order by the TiMBA team.

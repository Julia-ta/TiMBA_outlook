# Contributing to TiMBA

-----------------
Hello world, Thanks for your interest in contributing to TiMBA!

Below you can find some guidance to help streamline the integration of your code contributions or facilitate addressing
any issues you report.

To suggest and discuss possible improvements, new features, or to raise questions related to the use of TiMBA, we invite
you to contact us via [wf-timba@thuenen.de](mailto:wf-timba@thuenen.de) or initiate a topic under the [Github discussion section](#https://github.com/TI-Forest-Sector-Modelling/TiMBA/discussions). 

## Contributing code

-----------------
When contributing code to TiMBA, please consider the following guidelines:
- Follow PEP8 coding style. 
- Add docstrings for new functions and classes. 
- Include tests for any new feature or fix. 
- Keep commits small, clear, and focused.
- Submit pull requests with a clear description of the changes and reference the related issue (`Closes #issue number`).

If you are interested in adding a new feature to TiMBA, consider submitting your feature proposal via [wf-timba@thuenen.de](mailto:wf-timba@thuenen.de),
which is the preferred forum for discussing new features.

## Reporting issues

-----------------
When reporting issues, please include as much relevant information as possible as possible, such as your operating 
system, the TiMBA version and your python version. Whenever possible, please also include a brief, self-contained code
example that reproduces the problem. We provide an issue template to help to streamline the process and ensure that 
reports are clear and actionable.

Given our team size and limited capacities, we cannot garantee short-notice solution for all issues. Contributions in 
the form of self-initiated fixes or suggestions are therefore highly appreciated.
